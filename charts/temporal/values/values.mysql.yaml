# This is an example of using an external MySQL database for Temporal persistence and visibility.
# Replace `_HOST_`, `_USERNAME_`, and `_PASSWORD_` with your MySQL database host, username, and password.

# Note: This instructs the chart not to try and install MySQL itself, using an external MySQL instance will still work.
